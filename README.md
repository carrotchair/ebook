<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was written using this example: https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/.
I was using it before I got my first job as java junior and now I have changed it thanks for my experience.

It's an online shop for books. We have one class Book which is extended by all books. We have 4 types of books: regular, ebook, antique book and science journal.
Every regular book and ebook has genre.
Antique book is written before 1900.
Science journal has science index.
On the first page (check BookController) we will see 5 books as advertisement.
